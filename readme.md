# Cryptography experiments


So far, just one experiment:

I wanted to learn more about how cryptography works so I read [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1321](RFC 1321) where the MD5 hashing function is described and implemented it myself in ruby.


### TODO:

Ideas on other experiments:
* look up the vulnerabilities people found and see if I can crack my own implementation by creating a collision?
* Try making a SHA1, SHA256 etc.? If they're similar enough maybe I could make an abstraction that would let me easily add more hashing functions.
